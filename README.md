<p>The Student Assistant application is a convenient tool for first-year students who are just starting to study at a new university. One of the main problems of these students is the difficulty of navigating a new place, as well as planning their day and finding the right audience.<p/>

<h3>Problem‚ùì:</h3> First-year students find it difficult to get used to their new place of study, plan their day, find an audience, etc.

<h3>Solution‚ùó:</h3> An application that will analyze the student‚Äôs schedule, location, etc. and give advices.
